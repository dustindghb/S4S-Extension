### Viewing Analysis Results
- Click "View Last Analysis" to see the most recent analysis
- **Side-by-side comparison** of OpenAI and Ollama results
- Analysis results include:
  - Frame-by-frame descriptions
  - Website identification
  - Text content details
  - User interaction summaries
  - Chronological flow
  - Processing information (grayscale, models used)

## Technical Details

### Frame Extraction
- Uses Canvas API to extract frames from videos
- Configurable frame rate (default: 0.5 frames per second)
- **Grayscale conversion** option for improved efficiency
- Supports WebM, MP4, AVI, and MOV formats

### AI Analysis
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API**: Cloud-based analysis
- **Ollama Vision Models**: Local analysis via HTTP API (supports multiple models)
- Sends extracted frames as base64 images
- Processes multiple frames in a single API call
- **Parallel processing** for faster results
- Provides detailed content analysis

### Grayscale Processing
- Converts frames to grayscale before analysis
- Reduces processing time and API costs
- Maintains analysis quality for most use cases
- Can be disabled for full-color analysis

### Storage
- Analysis results stored locally in Chrome storage
- Settings persisted across browser sessions
- No data sent to external servers except OpenAI API
- Ollama analysis runs entirely locally

## Configuration

### Frame Rate
- Controls how many frames are extracted per second
- Higher rates provide more detail but increase processing time
- Recommended: 0.5-1.0 frames per second

### Analysis Prompts
- **OpenAI Prompt**: Customize the prompt sent to GPT-4 Vision
- **Ollama Prompt**: Customize the prompt sent to all Ollama vision models
- Different prompts can be used to get varied perspectives
- Default prompts focus on detailed content analysis

### Grayscale Processing
- **Enabled by default** for efficiency
- Reduces frame size and processing time
- Can be disabled for full-color analysis
- Recommended for most use cases

### Auto-Analysis
- Toggle automatic analysis after recording
- When disabled, recordings are saved without analysis
- Manual analysis can be performed later

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API Key Required" error**
- Make sure you've entered your OpenAI API key in the options
- Ensure the API key has Vision API access

**"Cannot connect to Ollama server" error**
- Ensure Ollama is installed and running
- Check that the server URL is correct (default: http://localhost:11434)
- Verify the model is installed: `ollama list`

**"No frames could be extracted" error**
- Check that the video file is not corrupted
- Try a different video format (WebM recommended)
- Ensure the video has valid content

**Analysis fails**
- Check your internet connection (for OpenAI)
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check Ollama server is running (for Ollama analysis)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Performance Tips
- Use lower frame rates for longer videos
- Enable grayscale processing for faster analysis
- Close unnecessary browser tabs during recording
- Ensure stable internet connection for OpenAI analysis
- Use local Ollama for privacy-sensitive content
